# hello-world
I'm in Programming 1 learning C++. This is my first foray into programming so... Don't expect greatness just yet.
I want a job someday that doesn't involve hearing complaints about breadsticks at Olive Garden.
Interests include drag queens, skate videos from the early aughts, and the oxford comma.
